Adds a floating widget area to your site, summoned by an icon fixed in the bottom right corner.

== Description ==

Floating Widget Area is a plugin for Wordpress that creates an icon that summons a widget area on the right hand side of your screen.
The source image for the icon can be configured in the plugin's settings menu.
If you don't want the icon to display on mobile devices, you can set a minimum browser width in the settings as well.
If you use contact form 7, there is a form built in to this plugin that you can copy to start using contact form 7 with this plugin.

Also all elements that are a child of the floating widget area are given a class "floating-menu-child".
You can use this if you choose to edit/override the CSS styling.
